\section{Abstract}
In this paper a comprehensive metadata model for document management systems of the \emph{Landesanstalt f\"ur Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-W\"urttemberg} (LUBW) is created. The LUBW runs different Web portals, which have grown independently for historical reasons and therefore use different metadata models. This portals will be studied and analyzed how the metadata models can be unified.

The aim of this paper is to clarify if each of the respective metadata models can be represented by a combination of reusable and standardized metadata components. For the implemtation of a prototype system und as a proof of concept, different \emph{Enterprise Content Management} (ECM) systems need to be analyzed and a suitable system will be selected to build the prototype upon.

It is described how the unified metadata model can be implemented using Alfresco, one of the most popular ECM systems. 

After the development of the backend, different options for building a user frontend based on a Liferay portal server, in particular, an implementation based on \emph{Content Management Interoperability Services} (CMIS).
